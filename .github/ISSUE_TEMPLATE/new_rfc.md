| **Authors** | This should be an @mention of your own Github name, plus @mentions of anybody else involved in authoring this RFC. |
| **To be reviewed by** | Set this to *at least* one week out. The maintainers reserve the right to update this date if deemed necessary. |

## Need

This section should define the need that completing this RFC would meet, *not* what needs to be built. For example...

> Every developer that uses `fdgt` has developed a case of numb tongue. `fdgt` **needs to stop giving developers numb tongue.**

Feel free to get more verbose and specific with the needs. The more detail, the better we can understand how the "Approach" section is solving the problem.

## Approach

This section should layout how you believe we should approach solving this need. Do we need to perform an in-depth study? Do we need to query our users? Do we need to throw rotten tomatoes at Twitch until they give us what we want? What approach (or approaches) should we take to come up with a solution?

*A word of warning:* Avoid getting into implementation details if you can help it. We don't want to hamstring the developers that end up working on this, and we want to give commenters an opportunity to imagine their own solutions that may come from the approach before commenting.

## Benefits

The benefits of meeting the "Need" may be obvious to you, but they may not be obvious to everybody. Take this opportunity to get specific and rethink your own understanding of the benefits here.

## Alternatives

If there are alternative approaches that we could take, make sure to list them here. If an alternative approach is a bad idea, or there's a specific reason why you chose the "Approach" over this, *make sure to mention that, too.*

## Acknowledgements

Very rarely do we come up with big ideas in isolation. Make sure to say thank you to everybody that helped in the ideation of this RFC but didn't necessarily contribute to its authorship.
