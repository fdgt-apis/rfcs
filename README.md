# `fdgt` RFCs

This repository is intended to help `fdgt` users and maintainers and discuss major changes to the `fdgt` service.

## What's an RFC?

An RFC, or **R**equest **F**or **C**omment, is a document outlining some change or enhancement to a system. RFCs have a long history in the engineering industry, namely in the ISOC's[1] IETF[2] [3], the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet.

`fdgt` uses the ["Structured Request For Comment"](https://philcalcado.com/2018/11/19/a_structured_rfc_process.html) process proposed by [Phil Cal√ßado](https://philcalcado.com/). This allows us to propose large changes that may affect the community and our users without hearing from them first.

## Creating an RFC

To create a new RFC for `fdgt`, just open an issue! There is a template in place to help you create a great RFC.

## What should (or shouldn't) be an RFC?

Things that **should** be an RFC: breaking changes and new features should always come in as RFCs. Some smaller new features may be added without an RFC (think quality of life features), but most should make their way into development via the RFC process.

Things that **should not** be an RFC: bugs, technical support questions, and requests for new code examples. Bugs and technical support questions should all be created as issues on the [fdgt-apis/api](https://github.com/fdgt-apis/api) repository. Requests for new code examples should be created as issues on the [fdgt-apis/website](https://github.com/fdgt-apis/website) repository.
